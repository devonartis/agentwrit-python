# Live Test Guide

This is the step-by-step guide for how live tests are written and executed in this project. Every phase and fix must produce a live test following this process.

Read this entire document before writing or running any test.

## Who Reads These Tests?

**Executives and manual QA testers read every story and verdict.** They are the primary audience — not engineers. Every banner, every verdict, every piece of evidence must make sense to someone who has never seen a line of Go code.

- **An executive** reads the evidence folder to decide whether a release is safe. They need to understand: what changed, what could go wrong, and whether we proved it works. If they have to ask an engineer "what does this mean?", the evidence failed.
- **A QA tester** reads the story to understand what they are verifying. They need to be able to reproduce the test and write a verdict without understanding the broker's internals.
- **An engineer** reads the story last. If the evidence is clear enough for the first two audiences, engineers get what they need automatically.

**Write for audience #1 (the executive). The other two follow.**

**When to write these stories:** Immediately after the spec is approved — before writing any implementation code. The stories are the acceptance criteria. They define what "done" looks like. If the stories can't be written, the spec isn't clear enough to implement. See `.plans/Development-Flow.md` for the full process.

## Story Classification

Every story in `user-stories.md` MUST be tagged with one of two classifications
in its header. No untagged stories.

| Tag | Meaning | Gate Question | Example |
|-----|---------|---------------|---------|
| `[PRECONDITION]` | Verifies infrastructure or setup is in place. Smoke test. | "Is this proving a dependency works, not the feature itself?" | "AWS OIDC provider exists and is reachable" |
| `[ACCEPTANCE]` | Real-world E2E use case with a real consumer. | "Would a real user do this in production?" | "Python consumer validates token via JWKS" |

**The difference matters:**
- A `[PRECONDITION]` story checks that a tool, service, or dependency is
  available. It enables acceptance stories but does not prove the feature works.
- An `[ACCEPTANCE]` story proves a real user can accomplish a real task with
  the feature end-to-end. If you removed every `[ACCEPTANCE]` story and only
  had `[PRECONDITION]` stories, you'd have zero proof the feature works.

**Minimum bar:** At least one `[ACCEPTANCE]` story MUST involve a **real
third-party consumer** — something outside the broker that trusts and uses
the broker's output (a Python script validating tokens, AWS STS exchanging
a JWT for credentials, a resource server enforcing scopes). The broker
talking to itself is not acceptance.

**If you're unsure whether a story is ACCEPTANCE or PRECONDITION, ask:**
> "If this test passes but every other test is deleted, does a real user
> get value from the feature?"
>
> YES → `[ACCEPTANCE]`. NO → `[PRECONDITION]`.

### Story header format

```markdown
### P2-S25: Python Consumer Validates Token via JWKS [ACCEPTANCE]

The developer runs the Python validation script...
```

```markdown
### P2-PC1: AWS OIDC Identity Provider Exists [PRECONDITION]

The operator verifies that the AWS IAM OIDC identity provider...
```

Precondition stories use the prefix `PC` (e.g., `P2-PC1`, `P2-PC2`).
Acceptance stories use `S` (e.g., `P2-S25`, `P2-S26`).

---

## Infrastructure Prerequisites

Every `user-stories.md` MUST begin with an Infrastructure Prerequisites table.
This section lists everything that must exist before ANY test can run. Each
prerequisite maps to a `[PRECONDITION]` story that smoke-tests it.

**If a feature needs no external infrastructure, write "None — all tests run
against the local broker." Do NOT omit the section.**

```markdown
## Infrastructure Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Purpose | Smoke Test Story | Status |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| AWS account + IAM OIDC provider | STS federation E2E | P2-PC1 | NOT VERIFIED |
| ngrok (free tier) | HTTPS exposure for AWS | P2-PC2 | NOT VERIFIED |
| Python 3.10+ with PyJWT, cryptography | Consumer validation | P2-PC3 | NOT VERIFIED |
| Go 1.24+ compiled broker binary | VPS mode testing | P2-PC4 | NOT VERIFIED |
| Docker + docker-compose | Container mode testing | P2-PC5 | NOT VERIFIED |
```

**Rules:**
- Every external dependency gets a row. "External" = anything not the Go broker
  binary or Docker stack (AWS accounts, API keys, third-party tools, language
  runtimes, Python packages, ngrok, DNS, HTTPS certificates, etc.)
- Every row maps to a `[PRECONDITION]` story — no prerequisites without a
  smoke test that proves the dependency works
- Status starts as `NOT VERIFIED` and gets updated to `VERIFIED` during
  Step 7.9 (Preflight Check) before live tests run
- **If a prerequisite cannot be verified, live tests STOP.** Missing
  infrastructure = no acceptance testing. Tests against missing infrastructure
  are fiction, not tests.

---

## What Is a Live Test?

A live test is an operator, developer, or security reviewer sitting at a terminal, running commands against the real broker, and recording what happened. It is NOT a script, NOT a bash chain, NOT automation. It's a person doing the thing and saving the evidence.

A live test runs against one of two deployment modes:

- **VPS Mode:** The compiled broker binary running directly on the host (`./bin/broker`). This is how the broker runs on a VPS, EC2 instance, or bare-metal server.
- **Container Mode:** The broker running inside Docker (via `docker run` or `./scripts/stack_up.sh`). This is how the broker runs in Kubernetes, ECS, or Docker Compose environments.

**Neither `go run` nor unit tests count as live tests.** The broker must be a compiled binary, either running directly or inside a container.

### VPS First, Container Second

> **Rule:** Every acceptance story that involves the broker runs in VPS mode
> first, then Container mode second. This is not optional.

- **VPS mode proves the application works.** No Docker layers, no volume mounts, no container networking. If it fails here, the bug is in the Go code.
- **Container mode proves the deployment works.** If VPS passes but Container fails, the bug is in Docker config, not in the application.
- **Testing both catches different bugs.** Hardcoded container paths, Docker UID mapping issues, missing env var passthrough — these only surface when you run both ways.

Each story's header must include a `**Mode:**` field indicating which modes it runs in (VPS, Container, or both). CLI-only stories (like `aactl init`) don't involve the broker and skip both modes.

See `docs/internal/dev-qa-guide.md` for full details on building and running in each mode.

---

## Directory Structure

Every phase or fix gets its own directory under `tests/`:

```
tests/<phase-or-fix>/
  user-stories.md     — all stories with personas, steps, acceptance criteria
  env.sh              — environment variables (source once before testing)
  evidence/
    README.md         — summary table with verdicts + open issues
    story-N-<name>.md — one file per story with banner + output + verdict
```

---

## Step 1: Write User Stories First

Before writing any code or running any test, write the user stories. Each story says who is doing what and why, in plain language.

```markdown
### P0-S3: Sidecar Activate Endpoint Is Gone

The security reviewer calls the old endpoint where a sidecar exchanged
its activation token for a bearer token. It should no longer exist.

**Route:** POST /v1/sidecar/activate
**Tool:** curl
**Expected:** 404
```

**Personas and their tools — never mix these:**
- **Operator** — uses `aactl` commands. Operators manage the broker, configure secrets, review audit trails. They don't hand-craft HTTP.
- **App** (or Application) — uses `curl` / HTTP client. An app is a registered software application that authenticates with client credentials, creates launch tokens, and manages its own agents. When a story is about an app authenticating, getting tokens, or registering agents — the persona is App, not Developer.
- **Developer** — uses `curl` / HTTP client. A developer is a person building an integration. When a story is about a human exploring the API, testing endpoints, or debugging — the persona is Developer.
- **Security Reviewer** — uses whichever tool proves the security property. The reviewer's job is to verify that security controls work: that errors don't leak, that revoked tokens are rejected, that headers are set.

**Choosing the right persona:** Ask "who is doing this action in production?" If it's automated software calling an API → **App**. If it's a human operating the system → **Operator**. If it's a human exploring or testing → **Developer** or **Security Reviewer**. Getting this wrong makes the story confusing — an executive reads "the developer validates a token" and thinks a person is doing it, when really it's an automated app.

---

## Step 2: Set Up the Environment

Before running any test:

1. Build aactl to `./bin/aactl` — not `/tmp/`, not `go run`
2. Run `./scripts/stack_up.sh` to bring up the Docker stack
3. Verify the broker is healthy: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/health`
4. Source the environment file once: `source ./tests/<phase>/env.sh`

The env.sh file sets the broker URL and admin secret so you don't repeat them on every command:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
export AACTL=./bin/aactl
export AACTL_BROKER_URL=$BROKER_URL
export AACTL_ADMIN_SECRET=change-me-in-production
```

---

## Step 3: Run Each Story and Record Evidence

This is the most important part. Each story is run ONE AT A TIME. The banner comes first, then the command runs, and the output is piped directly into the evidence file. The banner and the output are ONE thing — they go into the file together in a single call.

### How the Coding Agent Must Execute Each Story

The coding agent runs each story as a single bash call that:
1. Writes the banner (who, what, why, how, expected) into the evidence file
2. Runs the actual command and pipes the output into the same file
3. Appends the verdict
4. Displays the complete file so the user can see the full evidence

**This is how a call looks for a curl story:**

```bash
F=tests/phase-0/evidence/story-S3-sidecar-activate-gone.md
cat > "$F" << 'BANNER'
# P0-S3 — Sidecar Activate Endpoint Is Gone

Who: The security reviewer.

What: Before Phase 0, the broker had a route at POST /v1/sidecar/activate
where a sidecar exchanged its one-time activation token for a bearer token.
This was the most security-sensitive part of the sidecar flow — it's where
tokens were issued. We removed it because there are no sidecars in the stack.

Why: If this route still responds, someone with a stolen activation token could
potentially get a bearer token from the broker.

How to run: Source the environment file. Then send a POST to the old sidecar
activation URL on the broker.

Expected: HTTP 404 — the route no longer exists.

## Test Output

BANNER
source ./tests/phase-0/env.sh && curl -s -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}" \
  -X POST "$BROKER_URL/v1/sidecar/activate" >> "$F" 2>&1
echo "" >> "$F"; echo "" >> "$F"
echo "## Verdict" >> "$F"; echo "" >> "$F"
cat "$F"
```

After that runs, the agent reads the output and adds the verdict:

```bash
echo "PASS — The broker returned 404. The old sidecar activate route is fully removed." >> "$F"
```

**This is how a call looks for an aactl story:**

```bash
F=tests/phase-0/evidence/story-R1-register-app.md
cat > "$F" << 'BANNER'
# P0-R1 — Operator Registers a New App

Who: The operator.

What: The operator registers a new app called cleanup-test on the broker
using aactl. This is a regression test — app registration is the core
Phase 1A feature. We need to confirm it still works after removing the
sidecar routes and changing the admin login format in Phase 0.

Why: If app registration broke during the Phase 0 cleanup, it means the
cleanup damaged something it shouldn't have.

How to run: Source the environment file. Then run aactl app register with
the app name and scopes. Save the credentials — they're needed for R2, R3,
and R4.

Expected: The broker creates the app and returns app_id, client_id, and
client_secret. The CLI warns to save the secret.

## Test Output

BANNER
source ./tests/phase-0/env.sh && ./bin/aactl app register \
  --name cleanup-test --scopes "read:data:*,write:logs:*" >> "$F" 2>&1
echo "" >> "$F"; echo "" >> "$F"
echo "## Verdict" >> "$F"; echo "" >> "$F"
cat "$F"
```

### Key Rules for the Coding Agent

- **One story at a time.** Run one, get the output, record the verdict, then move to the next. Do NOT fire multiple stories in parallel — you lose the output.
- **Banner goes IN the call.** The who/what/why/how/expected is part of the bash command that writes the evidence file. It is not a separate step.
- **Output pipes into the file.** The command output goes directly into the evidence file with `>> "$F" 2>&1`. You don't copy-paste later.
- **Display the file after.** End every call with `cat "$F"` so the user sees the complete evidence.
- **Verdict is based on what you see.** After the call completes and you see the output, append the verdict. Don't pre-write "PASS" before you see the result.

---

## Step 4: What the Evidence File Looks Like When It's Done

This is a real completed evidence file from Phase 0. An executive, a QA reviewer, or another coding agent should be able to read this and understand exactly what happened without knowing anything about curl or HTTP:

```markdown
# P0-R4 — Audit Trail Records All the Activity

Who: The operator.

What: The operator pulls the full audit trail from the broker to check that
everything that happened during these tests was recorded. The audit trail is
how the operator knows what's going on — every app registration, every login,
every failed request gets logged. The operator checks for two specific events:
the app registration from R1 (app_registered) and the developer login from R2
(app_authenticated). The operator also scans the entire trail to make sure no
client_secret values leaked into the logs.

Why: If audit events are missing, the operator loses visibility into the system.
If secrets appear in audit records, that's a security breach. Both would be
serious regressions.

How to run: Source the environment file. Then run aactl audit events. Look for
app_registered and app_authenticated events. Check that no client_secret values
appear anywhere.

Expected: app_registered and app_authenticated events present. No client_secret
values in any event.

## The Banner — What It Must Contain

Every evidence file starts with a plain language banner. This is NOT optional. This is what makes the evidence readable by anyone.

The banner has five parts:

| Part | What it says | Bad example | Good example |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Who** | Which persona is doing this — and why them | "Developer (curl)" | "The security reviewer. Their job is to verify that error messages don't leak internal details that could help an attacker." |
| **What** | What they're doing, what changed, and the business context — in plain English | "POST /v1/token/validate with an invalid token" | "An app sends a token to the broker to check whether it should trust an agent. The token is invalid — maybe it expired, maybe it was tampered with. Before this fix, the broker told the app exactly WHY the token was bad (e.g., 'token contains an invalid number of segments'). Now it gives a generic message." |
| **Why** | Why this test matters — what goes wrong for real users if it fails | "H3: JWT errors must not leak" | "If the broker reveals why a token failed, an attacker can use that information to craft better forged tokens. For example, knowing 'invalid signature' vs 'expired' tells the attacker the token format is correct and they just need a better key." |
| **How to run** | Step-by-step instructions a QA person can follow. If emulating an app, say so. | "curl -X POST /v1/token/validate -d ..." | "Source the environment file. We emulate what an app does in production: it sends a token to the broker's validate endpoint to check if the token is trustworthy. We deliberately send a bad token to see what error message comes back." |
| **Expected** | What the output should be — plain language first, then the technical detail | "Generic error, no JWT internals" | "The broker says the token is invalid but does NOT reveal why. The error message should say 'token is invalid or expired' — nothing about signatures, segments, or algorithms." |

### Ground Every Story in Reality

Before writing a story, ask: **"Is this really how this would work in the real world?"**

- If the story says "the developer validates a token" — would a developer really do that manually in production? No. An **app** validates tokens as part of its normal operation. The persona should be App, and the story should say the app is validating tokens it received from agents to decide whether to trust them.
- If you're running a script or curl command to emulate what an app would do, **say so explicitly** in the How section: "We emulate what the app does in production by sending the same HTTP request the app would send."
- If the test is purely a security verification (like "does the error message leak internals?"), that's a Security Reviewer story — and the How should explain that the reviewer is deliberately sending bad input to check what comes back.

**The test must reflect production reality, not testing convenience.** A story that describes something no real user would ever do is not a useful acceptance test — it's a unit test pretending to be one.

### The Mental Model — Who Is Reading This?

The banner has two audiences, and it must work for both:

1. **The QA tester** reads the banner to understand what they are verifying. They need to know: what is being tested, what a passing result looks like, and what a failing result means. They should be able to run the test and write a verdict without understanding the internals of the system.

2. **The executive** reads the banner to understand the business risk. They need to know: what changed, why it matters, and what goes wrong if this test fails. They should be able to read the evidence folder and walk away knowing whether the release is safe — without asking an engineer to translate.

**The banner tells a story, not a checklist.** Each story has a character (who), a situation (what changed and what they're doing), stakes (why it matters — what breaks if this fails), and a resolution (what a good outcome looks like). If the Why section doesn't make a non-technical person uncomfortable about the failure scenario, it's too abstract.

Think of it this way: the What explains "here's what we built." The Why explains "here's what happens to customers if we got it wrong." The Expected explains "here's how we know we got it right."

### Banner Language Rules

**Write it like you're explaining to a manager, not an engineer.**

GOOD: "The operator tries to log in to the broker using the command line tool. Before this fix, the login required two fields — a username and a password. Now it only requires the password."

BAD: "The operator authenticates with the broker using the new admin auth shape. The broker validates the shared secret using constant-time comparison and returns a short-lived admin JWT."

GOOD: "If this route still responds, someone with a stolen activation token could get a bearer token from the broker."

BAD: "If the endpoint is still registered in the mux, the sidecar bootstrap flow remains exploitable via token replay."

## Rules

1. **VPS first, Container second.** Every broker story runs as a compiled binary first (VPS mode), then in Docker (Container mode). See "VPS First, Container Second" above.
2. **Compiled binaries only.** Build to `./bin/broker` and `./bin/aactl`. Never use `go run` for live tests.
3. **Stories first.** Write user stories before writing any test code or running any command.
4. **Personas matter.** Operator uses `aactl`. Developer uses `curl`. Never mix.
5. **Banner is mandatory.** Every evidence file starts with who/what/why/how/expected in plain language.
6. **Mode is mandatory.** Every story header includes `**Mode:**` — VPS, Container, both, or CLI-only.
7. **Plain language.** An executive should be able to read the evidence and understand what happened. No jargon, no unexplained flags, no abbreviations.
8. **One story at a time.** Run one, record the output, write the verdict, then move to the next. Don't fire multiple stories in parallel.
9. **Output goes in the file.** The command output pipes directly into the evidence file. Don't copy-paste later.
10. **One file per story.** Named `story-N-<slug>.md`. If a story has both VPS and Container modes, both go in the same file with separate sections.
11. **Source env.sh once.** Don't inline env vars on every command.
12. **Verdict is earned.** Don't write PASS before you see the output. Read the result, then write the verdict.
